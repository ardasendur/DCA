Docker Swarm
-> Initialize cluster with swarm  docker swarm init --advertise-addr <Private_Ip> 
   you can see the number of managers  and node from docker info part
 -> you can list the current nodes in the swarm docker node ls (manager does count as a node )
 -> To generate token for join as a worker:
       docker swarm join-token worker 
       docker swarm join --token <TOKEN>
 - > According to the docker swarm architecture manager can speak with other manager and worker.
 - > Worker cannot speak with each other.
 - > Manager node use RAFT algorithm to make a concensus. This algorithm provides cluster work healthy.
 
 Docker Swarm Restore and Backup : 
      -> In a prodcution environement , it's always a good idea to back up critical data
        Steps for backup : 
            -> Stop the docker service (sudo systemctl stop docker)
            -> Back up all data in the directory /var/lib/docker/swarm (sudo tar -zvcf backup.tar.gz -C /var/lib/docker/swarm .)
            -> Start docker service (sudo systemctl start docker)
       Steps for restore : 
             -> Stop the docker service (sudo systemctl start docker)
             -> Delete the existing docker swarm file (rm -rf /var/lib/docker/swarm/*)
             -> Copy files (sudo tar -zxvf backup.tar.gz -C /var/lib/docker/swarm/) 
             -> Start the docker (sudo systemctl start docker)
